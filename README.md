**What I Am Currently Working On//Learning**

I am currently working on developing a windows program that can be used to control drones. This program implements the use of the MAVLink protocol, of which is used by open-source ground control software [Mission Planner](https://ardupilot.org/planner/) and [QGroundControl](http://qgroundcontrol.com/)
<br>
<br>
The idea of this project was to not only learn how to use the [MAVLink](https://mavlink.io/en/) APIs, but to also understand and apply the concepts of both the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern and the relatively new open-source cross-platform UI framework [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/). Last but not least, it was also an important avenue that exposed me to the world of GitHub.
<br>
<br>
That being said, the repository of this program is private, but should you be interested in finding out more about what i have done so far, please feel free to contact me at my email address. It would definitely be great if i could find a team of collaborators to work on this with!
